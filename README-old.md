### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jeff Adler, a full stack web developer primarily working in Javascript and React, and Ruby on Rails. I build apps that people love with code that people can read!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an app to put mentorship in the palm of your hands through a swipe-based mobile app MentorMe.
