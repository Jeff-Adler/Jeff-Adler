### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jeff Adler, a full stack web developer with a passion for innovation and eye for value creation! Most of apps are written in Javascript and React, and Ruby on Rails. I am committed to writing code that communicates its function, to continually testing, optimizing, and iterating the apps I writ, and to creating technology that people love!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an app to put mentorship in the palm of your hands through a swipe-based mobile app MentorMe. 
Check out the walkthrough: https://www.jeff-adler.com/project/2020-10-05-mentorme and repo: https://github.com/Jeff-Adler/mentorMe-frontend

I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities for collaboration and feedback on any of my work, so please reach out!
